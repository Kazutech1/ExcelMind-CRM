üöÄ Deployment
Production Considerations
Environment Variables: Set production values for all environment variables

Database: Use a managed PostgreSQL service with connection pooling

File Storage: Consider cloud storage (S3, Cloud Storage) instead of local filesystem

HTTPS: Always use HTTPS in production

CORS: Configure CORS for your frontend domain

Rate Limiting: Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse

Monitoring: Set up logging and monitoring

Docker Deployment
dockerfile
# Dockerfile
FROM node:18-alpine

WORKDIR /app

COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci --only=production

COPY dist/ ./dist/
COPY prisma/ ./prisma/
COPY uploads/ ./uploads/

RUN npx prisma generate

EXPOSE 3000

CMD ["node", "dist/main"]
üìà Monitoring and Logging
Recommended Setup
Logging: Use Winston or NestJS built-in logger with structured logging

Monitoring: Integrate with Prometheus and Grafana

Error Tracking: Use Sentry or similar service

Performance: Implement APM tools like New Relic or DataDog

üîÑ API Versioning
The API uses URI versioning:

text
/api/v1/courses
/api/v1/assignments
üìã Rate Limiting
Implement rate limiting to protect against abuse:

typescript
// Example rate limiting configuration
ThrottlerModule.forRoot({
  ttl: 60,        // Time-to-live in seconds
  limit: 10,      // Maximum requests per TTL
}),
